I am an Application Developer at [IBM](http://ibm.com), where I have the opportunity to work on innovative projects aimed at improving and optimizing business processes through automation. My passion for technology and programming has driven me to specialize in this field, where every day presents new challenges and opportunities.

In addition I am currently studying Computer Science at the [Universit√† Degli Studi di Salerno](http://unisa.it). 

The combination of my theoretical education and practical experience allows me to approach work challenges with a broad and informed perspective.
